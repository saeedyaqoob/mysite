        <p class="intro">
            I’m an IT Engineer, and I specialize in efficient Data Center Management and IP data
            networking. I am serious about my work for ensuring proper and seamless functioning of the Data Center and
            the associated applications.<br>

            My professional life has always been driven by my passion for solving problems and easing difficult tasks. I
            was always keen to learn "computer" stuff as a kid and would go around resolving issues on my own. Since the
            last two and a half years, I've been working with a semi-government company, C-DAC Mohali, India for a
            National project under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Govt. of India. I am in-charge of maintaining the
            proper functioning of the Data Center.<br>

            I have always loved to code and was always good at it because of my thorough problem solving and analytical
            skills. I used to code from an early age, but wasn't able to realize it in a professional scenario. However,
            as they say - It's never too late, so I started learning Python since last year and am working on it to
            become a backend developer. I also started learning Django and right now and I'm excited about it. In the following years, 
            I therefore plan to explore further in both backend as well as frontend together and become a full-stack developer.
